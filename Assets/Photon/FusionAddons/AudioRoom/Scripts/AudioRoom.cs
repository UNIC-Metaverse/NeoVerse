     * Audio rooms are defined by the `AudioRoom` component.
     * Each `AudioRoom` has a specific `Id` and registers itself on the `AudioRoomManager` during the `Awake()`.
     * The `IsIsolated` bool is used to define whether players located into the room are isolated from others.
     * When the door move, the `Isolate()` methods is called (by `AudioDoor`) and checks if a player is located into the room to ask him to update the audio group filtering thanks to `OnCurrentRoomIsolationChange()` method.
